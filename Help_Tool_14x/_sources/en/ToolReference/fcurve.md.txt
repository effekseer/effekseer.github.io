# F-Curve

## Overview

This is a feature that lets you automate frame-by-frame values over time by defining curves in a graph.

## How to use

### Display Graph

When you specify the F-curve for each item (position, rotation, etc.), their graphs will be displayed in the F-curve window.

When you select an item in the tree on the left side of the screen, the F-Curve is displayed. You can also select multiple items at the same time by holding down Shift and selecting items.

### Movement / Scaling of Graphs

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>Move graph</td>

<td>On the graph, move the mouse while right clicking.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Horizontal scaling</td>

<td>On the graph, hold down Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Vertical scaling</td>

<td>On the graph, hold down Alt and scroll the mouse wheel.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

### Add key frame

You can add a key by left double clicking the mouse on a line.

### Delete key frame

You can remove a key by left double clicking the mouse on the key.

### Select key frame

You can select by left clicking the mouse.

### Move key frame

After selecting the key, you can move it by moving the mouse while holding down the left mouse button. In the same way, you can also move the handles that control the curves.

### Enlarge, shrink anchor

You can specify a position of an anchor automatically by selecting the key and pressing enlarge anchor or chrink anchor buttons. Pressing enlarge anchor expands the anchor and smoothes the line. Pressing shrink anchor merges positions between key and anchors and makes a F-Curve sharp.

### Show entire graph

You can show entire graph by left double clicking a corresponding graph's label.

## Parameter

### Frame

Set for each key. Specify the frame of the key.

### Value

Set for each key. Specify the value of the key.

### Type

Set for each key. Specify the interpolation method between this key and its neighboring keys.

### Start

Set for each graph. Specify how values before the left edge of the graph should be generated.

### End

Set for each graph. Specify how values after the right edge of the graph should be generated.

### Sampling

Set for each graph. When actually playing back, specify how many frames to use as the resolution for interpolation. The smaller the value, the more accurate the result will be to the actual shape of the graph.

### Left X/Y

Set for each key. Specify the position of the left handle of the key's curve control.

### Right X/Y

Set for each key. Specify the position of the right handle of the key's curve control.

### Max/Min Offset

Set for each graph. When using values, offset the range, randomly shift the value up or down the graph.
