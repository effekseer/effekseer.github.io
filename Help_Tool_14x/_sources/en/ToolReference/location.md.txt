# Position

## Overview

Provides parameters that control the node's position over time, partiuarly concerning the position relative to the parent particle.

## Parameter

### Position

Specifies the spawn position of the particle. This will influence the position of the particle relative to its parent particle. If there is no parent particle, or position is set to not inherit in the Basic Settings window, this will specify the absolute position instead.

#### Set Position

Place the particles at a fixed position.

#### Position, Velocity, Acceleration (PVA)

Specify the position, velocity and acceleration of the particle.

#### Easing

Specify the spawn and despawn positions, and the method of interpolating between these two positions over the lifetime of the particle.

#### F-Curve

Use the F-Curve window to control the position by defining automation curves.
