## UnrealEngine5

Supported UnrealEngine5

## Other

- Runtime: Particles generated at a small number of times will now interpolate their parent's position.
   For example, children of a fast-moving parent particle can now be generated at equal intervals.
- Editor: Added ability to configure amount of digits after decimal point in editor [by [@abvadabra](https://github.com/abvadabra), [#812](https://github.com/effekseer/Effekseer/pull/812)]
- Editor: Added ability to use dynamic expressions for middle point of Easing component. [by [@abvadabra](https://github.com/abvadabra), [#816](https://github.com/effekseer/Effekseer/pull/816)]
- API: Added `Manager::SetSpawnDisabled(Handle, bool)` function which allows to temporarily disable particles generation by effect instance [by [@abvadabra](https://github.com/abvadabra), [#808](https://github.com/effekseer/Effekseer/pull/808)]
- OpenGL Renderer: Fixed incorrect reset of sampler objects [by [@abvadabra](https://github.com/abvadabra), [#815](https://github.com/effekseer/Effekseer/pull/815)]
- Other: Performance has been improved when pausing effects or when effects are off-screen.
