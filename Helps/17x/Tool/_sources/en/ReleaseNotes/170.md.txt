   :align: center
```

### Level of Detail

Added the ability to change the behavior of particles based on distance to improve a performance of the effect.

```

### Kill Rules

Added the ability to specify a range within which particles will be discarded if they enter or exit within the specified range.

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/killRules_Box.png
   :align: center
```

### Triggers

Added the ability to remove or create specific particles from the application side.

### Rotation

Added the ability to rotate particles so that they face the camera.

### Ribbon, Track

#### Color Time

Added the ability to set the source of time to determine the color of ribbons and trajectories.

### Materials

#### New nodes

Light, Noise, and Gradient nodes have been added.

### Other

#### Interpolation support for generated time

Particles generated at a small number of times will now interpolate their parent's position.
For example, children of a fast-moving parent particle can now be generated at equal intervals.

#### Performance Improvements

Performance has been improved when pausing effects or when effects are off-screen.

#### Bug fixes

Various bugs have been fixed.

## Tools

### Overdraw display

Added a display method that shows the number of drawings as a drawing method.
