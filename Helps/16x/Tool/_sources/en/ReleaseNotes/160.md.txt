# 1.60

## Common

### Basic

- Added a behavior for child particles to follow the position of the parent particle in position inheritance.

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/BasicSettings/FollowParent.mp4"/></div>

### Position

- Added a method to move with a path

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/Location/NURBS-Curve.mp4"/></div>

- Added a View Offset to always show a particle on a center in a screen

### Scale

- Added FCurve(Single)

### force field.

- Added a lot of different force fields.

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/LocalForceField/Force.mp4"/></div>

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/LocalForceField/Wind.mp4"/></div>

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/LocalForceField/Vortex.mp4"/></div>

### Procedual Model

- Added Procedual Model.

In Effekseer, you can create simple models by simply adjusting parameters.
You can display your model as it is or use it for generating positions.

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/ProceduralModel/Ribbon.png
   :align: center
```

### Easing

- Added many easing types.

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/Easing/EaseInBounce.png
   :align: center
```

### Rendering

- Added many features to rendering

Up to six images can now be used to create a variety of expressions such as distortion, blending of images, and image cropping without the need for material settings.
Soft particles can now be used to create a natural boundary between the background and the image.

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/BasicRenderAd/alpha.png
   :align: center
```

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/BasicRenderAd/dist.png
   :align: center
```

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/BasicRenderAd/softparticle_far.png
   :align: center
```

- Added animation transitions with Fade

It uses linear completion for animation transitions.
This will ensure that the image does not change suddenly.

<div class="video_center"><video autoplay loop="true" muted="true" src="../../movies/Reference/BasicRenderSettings/Flip_Lerp.mp4"/></div>

- Textures are now loaded as NoMipMaps when the file name includes _NoMip.

### Material

Added a node to implement soft particles in materials.

Added a node to get the magnification of the effect.

### Dynamic parameter

Added a step function

### Optimization

- Implemented multi-threaded updates. Faster update speed.

- Geometry instances implemented. Improved speed when displaying multiple copies of the same model.

## Tool

### Packaging

- Added a feature to create a package.

You can export all the files related to an effect to a single package, or import them from a package.

### UI

- Changed the behavior of the docking panel

- Changed to frameless window (Windows)

### Recording

- Added a recording size scaling factor to the recording function.

### Options

- Added a setting to change the mouse mapping to manipulate the viewport (you can select Maya style, Blender style, etc.).

### Environment

- Add an option to show a ground

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../../img/Reference/Environment/ground.png
   :align: center
```

## Runtime

- Major refactoring of the C++ source code.

Safety has been improved.
However, a number of destructive changes have been made. Please read the readme of the runtime for details.
