# File - Export

## Default format
Exports the effect you are currently editing as an efk file.

The efk file is a play-only binary format that does not contain tool edit information.

Various resource files such as textures are not output, so a separate copy is required.

You can specify the enlargement ratio by specifying the file name of the export destination.

```eval_rst

## Effekseer package
Exports the currently editing effect as an efkpkg file.

An efkpkg file is a package file that contains one or more efkefc files and various resource files.

Specify the file name of the export destination to complete the export.
