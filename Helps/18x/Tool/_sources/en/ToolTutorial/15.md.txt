# 15.Let's Send triggers to change effects!

<div class="main">

## 概要

This chapter explains the trigger function of Effekseer.
The trigger function can change effects during playback.

For example, as shown in the following example, a weapon that is being charged with energy can be triggered to fire.

Double-click to send the trigger.

## Trigger function
Trigger is a mechanism that allows up to four triggers to be sent to the effect currently playing.
The triggered effect can change its behavior according to the parameters set in the node.

### Trigger settings
The behavior change by the trigger is set in [Common](../ToolReference/common.md).

### Sending triggers from the editor
Triggers can be sent from the controller panel.

### Send triggers from the game
There are APIs to send triggers to SDKs and plug-ins for each game engine.

## sample effect
This chapter explains using the sample file `TriggerLaser.efkefc`.

When an effect is played, the following actions are performed.
- `Charge` node particles are generated and child node particles continue to be generated.
- `Laser` node particles are not generated.

When trigger 0 is sent to the effect, the following operation is performed.
- `Charge` node particles are deleted and particle generation in child nodes stops
- `Laser` node particles start generating and child node particles are also generated

### Node to delete particles when triggered

## Tips
Particles deleted by a trigger may disappear instantly, which may be unnatural.
In this case, you can set `Fade out after delete` to make them disappear naturally by fading out.

</div>

In `Fade out within lifetime`, the particle is faded out by deletion due to lifetime, but not by deletion due to trigger.
In both of the following examples, the particles are deleted by the trigger, but the fade-out behavior is different.
