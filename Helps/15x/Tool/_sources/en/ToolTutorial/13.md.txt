# 13. Let's distort a background!

<div class="main">

## Overview

This chapter explains how to distort the background with Effekseer.
In recent games, there are effects that can distort the background.
By setting parameters in Effekseer, you can distort the background with effects.

## How to use

To distort a background, you need to specify an image which contains an information about distortion.
An image isn't drawn about color, but the image is drawn about distortion.

An image for distortion is almost same to an image for normal.

Red color expresses an intensity of distortion horizontally. 127 is center, 0 is left direction, 255 is right direction.
Green color expresses an intensity of distortion vercially. 127 is center, 0 is upeer direction, 255 is lower direction.
Blue color is ignored.

<p>Distorting image</p>
</div>

Please open effect1.efkproj.

In ```Basic render settings``` panel, Texture/Distortion1.png is specified as color image of Distortion node.
In ```Basic render settings``` panel, make distortion checked and make distortion enabled.
I recommend that you change a background image in ```Option``` panel to see easily.

## Distortion intensity

Specify distortion intensity in ```Basic render settings``` panel.

If you modify ```distortion intensity``` in ```Basic render settings``` panel, the distortion changes.
The greater ```distortion intensity```, the stronger the distortion.
The closer ```distortion intensity``` is to 0, the less distorted.

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>

<td>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/13/intesity_1.png">
<p>Distortion intensity : 1</p>
</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/13/intesity_3.png">
<p>Distortion intensity : 3</p>
</div>
</td>

</tr>
</table>
</div>

## Drawing priority

Basically, distortion only distorts a background, you can not distort your own effect.
However, you may want to distort your own effects.
In such a case, change the drawing priority in ```Depth``` panel.

Drawing priority determines the order of rendering between nodes. Normally, the node placed at the bottom of the node tree is drawn later.
If the drawing priority is different, the node with the higher drawing priority is drawn at a later time.

Nodes with this drawing priority less than -1 are distorted with the node whose drawing priority is 0 or more.

Let's change the drawing priority of the Particle node.
If you change the drawing priority, you can see that the particles of the Particle node are distorted to the Distortion node.

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>

<td>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/13/priority_off.png">
<p>Drawing priority : 0</p>
</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/13/priority_on.png">
<p>Drawing priority : -1</p>
</div>
</td>

</tr>
</table>
</div>

## Use case

Distortion can also be used with ring and UV scroll.
Radial distortion can be easily created by combining ring and UV scroll.

This effect is an example combining ring and UV scroll.
The image on the left was applied to the ring with adjusted parameters.
the center image is the result of applying left image without distortion.
The image on the right uses distortion with UV scroll.
White particles were scattered in all directions.

## Caution

If you play effects with other game engines, appearance may change.

Finally, I made it possible to download the effect created in this chapter.

## Summery

In this chapter, I explained about distortion.
If you specify distortion well, it will look better.
Let's use it.
