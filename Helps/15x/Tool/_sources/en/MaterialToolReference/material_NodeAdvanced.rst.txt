Material Node (Others)
=====================

Overview
========

There are other advanced nodes that cannot be classified.
You can easily make complicated expressions.

Node list
========


Fresnel
------------------------

The larger the surface direction is from the front, the larger the value is output.
You can specify the intensity in the properties.

Rotator
------------------------

The input value (mainly UV) is rotated and output.
Used to rotate an image on a material.
An angle is expressed as 1 per lap.

PolarCoords
------------------------

Outputs UVs located on the radiation from the center.
You can specify how many images are arranged in one round and the rotation angle.
