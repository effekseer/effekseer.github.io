# How to use

## Install effekseer plugin

Copy the addons directory in EffekseerForGodot package into your Godot project.

![](../img/Godot_addons.png)

Enable **Status** for **Effekseer for Godot** on the **Plugins** tab of **Project Settings**.

![](../img/Godot_plugins.png)

This completes the plugin installation.

## Resources

Copy your effect files (*.efkefc), textures, sounds, materials, etc. into the `res://` of your Godot project.

![](../img/Godot_resources.png)

### Import effects
The *.efkefc file is imported as a Godot resource.

![](../img/Godot_import_efkefc_success.png)

If successful, subresources such as textures, models and materials will be linked as shown above.

![](../img/Godot_import_efkefc_fail.png)

If the subresource is not linked, try re-importing.

#### scale setting
Sometimes the size of the loaded effect is small and you want to adjust the size. In that case, select the efkefc file, change the `scale` parameter on the Import tab and press the` Reimport` button.

You can change the size of the effect by changing the Scale of `EffekseerEmitter`, but this method may not be magnified depending on the effect settings.

## How to use in 3D scenes
Use an emitter (`EffekseerEmitter`) to emit the imported effect in a 3D scene. Emitters are the source of effects and are used by placing them in a 3D scene.

To play the imported effect file, add `Node` with` EffekseerEmitter` attached to the node tree.

First, add a `Node` with the` EffekseerEmitter` attached to the node tree. (Since it is 3D, it is `EffekseerEmitter` under `Spatial`)

![](../img/Godot_add_node_3d.png)

`EffekseerEmitter` has been added.

Then drag and drop the imported effect into the `Effect` property to specify it.

![](../img/Godot_emitter_scene.png)

Since `Autoplay` is checked, the effect will be displayed when you run the scene.

### Emitter's inspector

![](../img/Godot_emitter_inspector.png)

| Property | Description                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Effect   | Sets the effect resource to play on the emitter |
| Autoplay | If checked, the effect will be played automatically at the start of the scene (`_ready ()` timing) |
| Paused   | Set the pause state during playback |
| Speed    | Set the playback speed of the effect |
| Color    | Set the color of the effect |

## How to use in 2D scenes
Use an emitter (`EffekseerEmitter2D`) to emit the imported effect in a 2D scene. Emitters are the source of effects and are used by placing them in a 2D scene.

To play the imported effect file, add `Node` with` EffekseerEmitter2D` attached to the node tree.

First, add a `Node` with the` EffekseerEmitter2D` attached to the node tree. (Since it is 3D, it is `EffekseerEmitter2D` under `Node2D`)

![](../img/Godot_add_node_2d.png)

`EffekseerEmitter2D` has been added.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_nodetree.png)

Then drag and drop the imported effect into the `Effect` property to specify it.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_scene.png)

Since the coordinate base of the 2D scene is pixels, specify the scale of `Transform2D`.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_scale.png)

Since `Autoplay` is checked, the effect will be displayed when you run the scene.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_play1.png)

If the effect looks different than you expected, adjust `orientation`.
For `orientation`, you can specify the angle of rotation for each XYZ axes.

![](../img/Godot_emitter2d_orientation.png)

The effect was displayed in the correct orientation.

### Emitter2D's inspector

| Property  | Description                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Effect   | Sets the effect resource to play on the emitter |
| Autoplay | If checked, the effect will be played automatically at the start of the scene (`_ready ()` timing) |
| Paused   | Set the pause state during playback |
| Speed    | Set the playback speed of the effect |
| Color    | Set the color of the effect |
| Orientation | Set the 3D orientation of the effect |


## Project settings

You can configure Effekseer's overall settings from Godot's project settings.

![](../img/Godot_project_settings.png)

| Property           | Description            |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Instance Max Count | Maximum number of instances generated by a node at the same time |
| Square Max Count   | Maximum number of rectangles used for drawing at the same time |
| Draw Max Count     | Maximum number of draw calls at the same time |
| Sound Script       | Script used for sound playback. Can be replaced |
