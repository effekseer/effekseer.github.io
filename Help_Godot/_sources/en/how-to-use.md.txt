Enable **Status** for **Effekseer for Godot** on the **Plugins** tab of **Project Settings**.

This completes the plugin installation.

## Resources

Copy your effect files (*.efkefc), textures, sounds, materials, etc. into the `res://` of your Godot project.

### Import effects
The *.efkefc file is imported as a Godot resource.

![](../img/Godot_import_efkefc_success.png)

If successful, subresources such as textures, models and materials will be linked as shown above.

If the subresource is not linked, try re-importing.

#### scale setting
Sometimes the size of the loaded effect is small and you want to adjust the size. In that case, select the efkefc file, change the `scale` parameter on the Import tab and press the` Reimport` button.

You can change the size of the effect by changing the Scale of `EffekseerEmitter`, but this method may not be magnified depending on the effect settings.

## Emitter
Emitters are the source of effects and are used by placing them in a 3D scene.

To play the imported effect file, add `Node` with` Effekseer Emitter` attached to the node tree.

Then drag and drop the imported effect into the `Effect` property to specify it.

Since `Autoplay` is checked, the effect will be displayed when you run the scene.
